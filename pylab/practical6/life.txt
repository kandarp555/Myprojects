Hello, my name is Kandarp Raval.
I am pursuing my B.Tech from Adani Institute of Infrastructure Engineering.
My hobbies include playing guitar, singing songs, playing table tennis, and practicing mentalism.
I am a foodie and enjoy tasting different types of foods.
I also like to practice spirituality, and naturopathy is a part of my routine.
I believe we are all interconnected with each other and are small parts of this vast, infinite universe.
